                <p><span>Acquisitions:</span> Whether you want to grow your business through expansion into new geographic regions or through the addition of new product lines or services, Brocair can advise your company on the strategic acquisition of a business. Through the use of our proprietary research tools, industry knowledge, and international footprint, Brocair can conduct a global acquisition search, or a geographically targeted acquisition search.
                </p>
                <p><span>Divestitures:</span> When it is the right time to sell your business or divest part of your business, Brocair can help you maximize the value you receive by conducting a structured sale process. Brocair maintains personal relationships with a wide range of executives across the spectrum of the healthcare industry, and can contribute unique business intelligence to the transaction process.
                </p>

            <section class="rightSection">
                <p><span>Management Buy-Outs:</span> Brocair helps incumbent management teams acquire their business from its existing owners, known as a "Management Buy-Out" or an "MBO". We can also help pre-formed executive teams acquire a business to operate, known as "Management Buy-Ins" or "MBIs".
                </p>
                <p>Brocair works with these teams to negotiate and structure an acquisition, and will conduct a process to arrange equity and debt financing on favorable terms to support an executive team with pre-packaged financing.

                <p><span>Equity Financings:</span> Brocair maintains a proprietary system to identify likely equity finance sources, based on the specific parameters of the situationâ€”including the size of the financing, the geographic region of the company, the type of transaction, and the part of the healthcare sector in which the company operates. Further, the principals of Brocair maintain a diverse set of personal relationships with senior investment professionals throughout the industry.</p>
                <p>Whether your company is looking for financing to support its research and development activities, or whether you are looking to finance a new phase of commercialization, Brocair can help you arrange financing from the most appropriate set of investors for your situation.</p>
            </section>
            <section class="rightSection">
            	<p><span>Debt Financings:</span> Whether you are a private equity investor looking for a dividend recapitalization, or an executive looking for the best non-dilutive or minimally-dilutive financing strategy, Brocair can help arrange financings from senior secured loans, to mezzanine notes (which are generally subordinated debt with equity features), to asset-based financing. Brocair has the proprietary research tools and lender relationships to help structure the right transaction with the right partner to achieve your strategic objectives.</p>
                
                <p><span>Restructurings:</span> Brocair can help you refinance your company under a new, more advantageous structure to position your firm for faster growth and improve your company's bottom line.</p>

                <p>Brocair works with clients to help them decide the optimal structure of debt to equity, and the right terms for each, by conducting an intensive internal review and modeling each scenario. Next, we will use our proprietary research tools and our existing relationships with investors and lenders to help you create the optimal capital structure for your business.

                <p><span>Corporate Carve-Outs or Divestitures:</span> There are many reasons why streamlining your business operations through a strategic divestiture could make sense.  Whether it is a subsidiary business entity, or simply a business line, Brocair can help you maximize the value you receive by conducting a structured sale process. Brocair maintains personal relationships with a wide range of executives across the spectrum of the healthcare industry, and can contribute unique business intelligence to the transaction process.

                            <p>We were extremely pleased with the outcome when we sold our company. This was very much the result of a well orchestrated sales process by Brocair. Carefully selected prospects, well written investment memorandum and delicate handling of the potential buyers all contributed strongly to outstanding success.

                </p>
                <p>Brocair works with clients to conduct an internal review and to model scenarios.  We then use our proprietary research tools and our existing relationships with investors and lenders to help them organize a buyout of their public shareholders through the appropriate mechanism for each company's specific situation.</p>

            <section class="rightSection">
                <p><span>Joint Ventures:</span> Brocair can help you negotiate and finance a joint venture. Often these are used to accomplish an entrÃ©e into a new geographic region, particularly when a local partner can provide specific expertise. Alternatively, JVs can be a strategy for a company to finance an acquisition by teaming up with professional investors who can help "sponsor" a transaction.
                </p>
                <p>The subsequent JV will not be 100% owned by the corporate buyer, but it can help extend the buyer's footprint into a new part of the industry. Brocair can help a client find the right partner, whether a corporate or a financial entity. In addition, Brocair can work with our international colleagues to help our clients find the optimal structure in international markets, where there may be specific regulatory or cultural factors that can make or break a joint venture.</p>
