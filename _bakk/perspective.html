            <p class="sectionHeading">Brocair Partners was founded on the principle that to be an effective advisor in a rapidly-changing, heavily-regulated, and often science and technology-driven industry like healthcare, you must provide more than just financial analysis skills.
            </p>
            <section>
                <p>Our people work hard every day to keep abreast of developments in a wide range of healthcare subsectors. We provide our clients with strategic insight and deep industry intelligence driven by ur in-house research efforts, our proprietary information system that tracks thousands of companies and institutional investors, and most of all our ongoing dialogues with hundreds of industry executives and investors.
                </p>
                <p>Our team is comprised of both healthcare industry-focused deal makers and former industry executives, which bring to bear a diversity of approaches and senior-level relationships with many strategic and financial buyers that often allow us multiple channels and points of entry in to these organizations.
                </p>
                <p>This real-time knowledge positions us to offer thoughtful strategic advice to our clients, placing us far along the learning curve at the beginning of a project. This gives our clients an advantage in terms of time and resources, and positions them to reach the very best outcome.

            <p class="sectionHeading">One of Brocair’s fundamental operating principles is that every project we take on is led directly by one or more of our most senior executives.  Each of our executives has managed many transactions and is intimately familiar with the dynamics of advisory assignments and is experienced with the twists and turns of negotiation.
            </p>
            <section>
                <p>Although every project is unique, our executives have long transactional experience, either as a financial advisor, a company executive, or both.  We will make recommendations, but we believe the most important factor to insure a successful transaction and a happy client is to listen.  We make every effort to ensure that our clients get the outcome that is the best fit for their requirements—usually this is getting the best valuation, but there are often other factors that are important to our clients (such as certainty of close, employee relations, or succession planning), and we understand that the “best deal” is sometimes more complex.
