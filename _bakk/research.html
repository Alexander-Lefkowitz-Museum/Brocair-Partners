                <h1>Executive Insight: Finding the Right Buyers for Your Healthcare Business</h1>
                <p>To get the highest value for a middle-market healthcare business in today’s environment, it is important to look beyond the obvious buyers. Often the best acquirers are the ones that are not at the top of the initial target list. And often they are not even those that are directly in a seller’s market, either in their offerings or their geography.</p>

                <p>When Brocair takes on a project, we spend a lot of time understanding our client’s industry ecosystem and considering possible buyers—including or ruling out proposed acquirers based on a number of quantitative and qualitative factors. In order to have a competitive process that elicits the best offers, it is critically important to start the marketing effort with the right audience already defined.</p>
                
                <p>As we evaluate possible buyers we are always thinking about what their angle is likely to be, and try to understand how each acquirer will approach the opportunity—do we think they are likely to leave the management team in place and run the business as a stand-alone operation, or would they integrate this into their existing operations and look for synergies (that would grow revenue or increase profitability).</p>

                <p>Throughout a project we are always on the lookout for indications of a buyer's motivation level, the valuation methodology they will employ, and other factors that will influence their go/no-go and valuation decisions. Ultimately, we believe that maintaining a strong focus on the buyer audience leads to significantly better terms and value for our clients.</p>

                <h1>Executive Insight: Contract Manufacturing Continues Rebound from 2009 Recession</h1>
                <p>Contract Manufacturing Organizations (CMOs) continue to make progress as they climb out of the malaise caused by both the financial collapse in late 2008 and the ongoing challenge to utilize their excess capacities. As Big Pharma continues to outsource more API manufacturing the large CMO players are well positioned to capture more of these opportunities.</p>

                <p>In 2012 a number of Western CMOs have stated that business has started to migrate back from Asia because of continued quality and environmental concerns. Both Generic and Traditional Pharmaceutical companies are demanding more accountability from their Asian CMOs particularly in Safety, Health and Environment issues for both employees as well as in the communities where their plants are located.</p>
                
                <p>Congress has recently passed expanded legislation and funding to empower the FDA to “Level the Playing Field” as it pertains to GMP inspections of foreign Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (APIs) CMOs. Recent trends are the manufacture of APIs for biosimilars, niche generics, cytotoxics, antibody drug conjugates (ADCs) and the more efficient syntheses of large scale generics utilizing proprietary manufacturing technologies.</p>

                <p>Brocair tracks the leading CMO’s worldwide and stays abreast of recent market developments. There continues to be opportunities worldwide for synergistic acquisitions or strategic divestitures in the CMO space and Brocair is well positioned to assist our clients regardless of their interest.</p>

                <p>Dear Friends,</p>

				<p>Autumn has begun, but temperatures are still hot in southeastern Brazil, where I recently spent a week meeting healthcare companies and investors with my colleagues at BroadSpan Capital.</p>

				<p>Brazil has seen spectacular growth in recent years, which has lifted millions of Brazilians out of poverty. In 2011 alone, 2.7 million Brazilians joined the 'C' class (Brazil classifies its economic classes from 'A's at the upper end of the scale, to 'E', at the bottom).</p>

				<p>This presents an opportunity for companies throughout the healthcare sector, as more people can afford to get preventative care and medical procedures that would have previously been out of reach.</p>

				<p>Anecdotally, I heard that business has been particularly good for companies that cater to aesthetic treatments (including both medical and dental), since people are often willing to spend money for cosmetic treatments even before other, more health-oriented, procedures.</p>
            </section>
            <section class="nudgeDown">
                <p>With respect to the capital markets, there are few publicly-listed healthcare firms in Brazil. It isn't entirely clear why this is so, but it is likely a legacy of historically poor corporate governance and tax compliance issues, though Brazil is improving rapidly in these areas.</p>

				<p>For now, however, Brazilian IPO candidates often have over US $50 million of EBITDA. This means most companies are still privately owned. Because of the complexities with local regulations, taxes, and the dynamics of family-owned companies, foreign buyers are often well advised to work with reputable local advisors when making an investment in Brazil.</p>

				<p>Brocair has a close affiliation with BroadSpan Capital, an independent investment bank focused on Latin America, with primary offices in Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo, Miami, and additional offices in several Brazilian states.</p>

				<p>In the attached PDF are some metrics on the Brazilian healthcare market, and recent transactions. Through our partnership with BroadSpan, Brocair has strong capabilities in Brazil. If there is anything we can do to help with your M&amp;A efforts in Brazil, please give me a call.</p>
