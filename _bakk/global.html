                <p>The United States is by far the largest, most diverse healthcare market in the world. According to the OECD, in 2010 health care spending represented 17.9% of U.S. GDP. The Department of Health and Human Services projects that this figure will rise to 19.5% of GDP by 2017.

                <p>Canada’s national health care system, called Medicare, is a federal, universal, single-payer system, governed and delivered by the provinces and territories.  Medicare provides first-dollar coverage for hospital and physician services.   Most services, however, are provided by the private sector.  Under each province’s regulation, citizens receive these services without cost; other benefits include portability between provinces and low-cost prescription drugs.  Each province decides for itself the level of “supplementary” benefits that it will provide, such as vision care, cosmetic procedures, and prescription drug coverage.

However, Japan spends only 9.5% of its GDP on healthcare—one of the lowest percentages among the industrialized nations.  With the aging of the population, demand is expected to triple in the next 25 years, according to a study by McKinsey, which is likely to drive that figure higher.

                <p>The healthcare industry in India is in need of high growth to fill existing gaps and meet increasing demand. In recent years, the Indian government has made commitments to invest more in healthcare and to help fill some of these gaps. In 2009, government investment in healthcare as a percentage of GDP was only 1.2%. By 2017, it is expected to grow to 2.5%. As the population grows, disposable incomes increase, and the country becomes more and more urbanized, healthcare needs are changing and the demand for higher quality of care is on the rise.

There are two main Social Security institutions that provide care for approximately 50 million of Mexico’s officially employed.  Additionally, healthcare is also provided by private institutions (privately-run hospitals, clinics, and pharmacies).  Healthcare expenses at private institutions are paid for through private insurance carriers or out-of-pocket payments.  It is estimated that only 3 million Mexicans have private health insurance, but this number is steadily growing.

            <div class="usLit">
                <p>The U.S. healthcare system is a complex mixture of government-insured and privately-insured services. According to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, in 2009, 27% of U.S. expenditures on health care were paid for by the federal government, 16% by state and local governments, 21% by private businesses for their employees, and 28% by households directly.</p>
                <p>
                The federal government pays for healthcare primarily from two programs—Medicare and Medicaid. Medicare provided health insurance for 48 million enrollees as of 2010. 40 million of these enrollees were over 65 years of age; 8 million wereyounger people with disabilities. Medicaid is a joint federal and state program for lower income people and families, administered by the states. In 2008, 49 million people received Medicaid benefits. Around 9 million people are covered by both Medicare and Medicaid—termed “dual-eligibles”. This population represents some of the sickest enrollees, and receives a disproportionately large percentage of the programs’ benefits.</p>
                <p>
                Most Americans under 65 receive private health insurance coverage through group coverage plans sponsored by their employers. In most cases, whether health insurance is provided by public or private insurers, the enrollee will still be responsible for some direct costs in the form of deductibles or co-payments.</p>
                <p>
                An analysis by Kaiser Permanente in 2009 showed that of every dollar spent on health care in the U.S., 31 cents was spent on hospital care, 21 cents on physician services or clinical services, 10 cents on pharmaceuticals, and 6 cents on in-patient long term care.</p>
            </div>


            <div class="canadaLit">
            <p>Three quarters of the population have private supplemental health insurance, which cover these supplementary benefits when they are not fully provided by their provincial/territorial health plan.  In Canada, virtually all dental care and most vision care is provided and funded privately.  Private plans also cover additional out-of-pocket costs for prescription drugs.
            </p><p>Drugs that are prescribed and consumed in hospitals are covered by provincial and territorial governments, through their public insurance plans or, alternatively, through direct financing of hospitals.  Drugs consumed anywhere outside a hospital setting, however, are only partially subsidized by the public sector.  Provincial and territorial drug plans, rather than being universal, tend to target vulnerable groups, such as the poor, the elderly, and the very sick.  In addition, these drug plans often do not always cover the full cost of drugs.  In certain cases, patients are charged a copayment or deductible. Private sector plans will pay drug costs for enrollees that are not covered by their provincial/territorial plans.
            </p><p>Private spending for insurance, drugs, and out-of-pocket expenses totals 30% of Canada’s annual health care spending.  The private healthcare participation level varies greatly from one province or territory to another, because the health plans in different jurisdictions cover different services, to different levels, from one another.  In 2007 out-of-pocket payments represented 15% of all health care expenditures, and private health insurance, either purchased by individuals or families or provided by employers represented 13% of health care spending.

                <p>In 1989, Brazil created the Sistema Único de Saúde (SUS), by merging two prior state systems, one for those in formal work and the other for the unemployed, retired, and informally employed.  The SUS was intended to provide universal health care to the country, and decentralized the management and organization of health care from the federal to the state and municipal level.  The 1988 constitution guarantees all citizens the right to free medical care from public and private providers, reimbursed by the government. 
                </p>
                <p>The public sector handles preventative and basic health care, as well as specialized healthcare, and operates nearly 1,800 general hospitals, while the private non-profit and for-profit sector delivers most medical services, including the operation of over 3,400 hospitals. The majority of hospitals are private, but are financed partly by the federal government and partly by the states. In spite of operating with a two-tier health care system, roughly 75% of the Brazilian population depends on the public sector to receive medical treatment, as only 18.5% of the population pays for private insurance. But in total, around 60% of all spending on health care in Brazil is private—a higher percentage than the United States.</p>
                <p>In 2011, the size of the Brazilian healthcare market was approximately $209bn USD. Analysts believe that the current positive economic growth and increase in formal employment in Brazil will drive healthcare spending and the expansion of private health insurance industry. Additionally, the higher prevalence of obesity, diabetes, HIV/AIDS, and cancer will provide opportunities for various healthcare stakeholders.
                </p><p>Among the healthcare sectors, the pharmaceutical market in the country has experienced tremendous growth, especially the generics market, which witnessed growth of more than 40% in 2011 against the previous year.  With several factors, such as increasing patent expiries and greater generic company involvement in Brazil, the segment is anticipated to be the main factor for growth of the pharmaceutical market in the country.  Additionally, the outlook of Brazil’s healthcare IT industry is quite optimistic as hospitals in the country are investing huge amounts of money in information technology.
                </p><p>While the swelling patient pool, which is driven both by the demographics of an aging population and the wider availability of medical care, attracts investors (although foreign investment in the provision of healthcare is heavily restricted), complex administrative processes and tax regimes hamper investment, procurement, and care. This necessitates expansion and modernization of the healthcare infrastructure in the country, especially in the public system.

                <p>The health care system in Japan is universal and mandatory, and is a hybrid system where funding comes from job-based insurance premiums and taxes.  There are a total of eight health insurance systems in Japan, organized in two categories, Employee’s Health Insurance (健康保険 Kenkō-Hoken) and National Health Insurance (国民健康保険 Kokumin-Kenkō-Hoken), for corporate employees and self-employed people and students, respectively.
                </p><p>The first Employee Health Insurance Plan, known as ‘kaihoken’, was created in 1927 and expanded in 1961, with costs starting to increase in the 1980s. The word ‘kaihoken’ means ‘healthcare for all’; it is a universal system based on compulsory insurance plans that covers employees (under 70 years old, the so-called ‘pre-elders’) and their families, with patients paying around 30 percent of medical costs. Within the National Health Insurance (NHI) scheme, patients enjoy total freedom to choose doctors, specialists and to decide where they receive treatment.  However the universal healthcare system, which has been in place for 50 years, is showing signs of strain.  In a country with the world’s oldest population, the disease mix is becoming more difficult to treat, with rates of cancer, stroke and Alzheimer's disease on the rise, and doctors and hospitals are increasingly strained.  Emergency care and serious medical conditions are sometimes overwhelmed by large numbers of patients seeking routine care.
                </p><p>The Japanese pharmaceutical market is the second largest in the world, after the United States, worth around $96.5bn in 2010, according to IMS Health. Recent growth rates have been significantly affected by currency fluctuations between the yen and U.S. dollar.  Even with the devastating aftershocks of the 2011 earthquake, Japan managed to resume economic production and the pharmaceutical industry, showing it has been built on a solid foundation.

            <p>The current inaccessibility of sufficient public healthcare services has caused many residents to turn towards the private sector and pay out of pocket. 70% of healthcare spending is out of pocket in India, most of which goes towards pharmaceuticals. 
                </p><p>State governments maintain the primary responsibilities for administering and funding health services, and pay nearly two thirds of total public healthcare costs, while the central government funds the remainder. Public healthcare services can also vary extensively from state to state due to differences in revenues between states. The result is often inadequate care for the poorest people in rural India. The National Rural Health Mission, launched in 2005, and the Rashtriya Swasthya Bima Yojana program, launched in 2007, are two programs designed to address this very issue by improving the delivery of healthcare and providing a government funded insurance plan for residents below the poverty line.
                </p><p>Multiple health insurance options are also available to middle and upper class residents of India, including employer sponsored health insurance. Nevertheless, only 10% of families had one or more members covered by an insurance plan in 2009.
                </p><p>While the government continues to find ways to expand and improve the current system, there is still a great deal of room for growth. The Indian healthcare industry is estimated at $65bn USD as of 2012, and is projected to reach $100bn by 2015. Foreign direct investment has pumped billions of dollars into this lucrative market over the past several years. 
                </p><p>The medical tourism market in India is worth $2.5bn USD and has inspired partnerships between hospitals and hotels. Expansion in the country’s information technology industry is leading to growth in telemedicine and electronic medical records. There is also a major gap in healthcare infrastructure which will largely have to be filled by private companies.
                </p><p>The introduction of product patents in India is expected to further boost the pharmaceutical industry by encouraging multinational companies to launch specialized life-saving drugs. Attracted by the advantages of low-cost production and a skilled workforce, these companies are looking to set up research and development and production centers in the country.

            <div class="swedenLit">
                <p>Health care funding is drawn from central government and local government taxes, but most services have a cost-sharing component, with patients responsible for a modest co-payment for physician consultations or hospital stays.  For pharmaceuticals, there is a deductible for which the patient is responsible, and above that amount, there is a cost sharing component.
                </p><p>County councils are responsible for providing funding for mental health care, primary care, and hospital services; municipalities are responsible for funding home care, home services, and nursing home care.  In 2005 public funding accounted for 85% of health expenditures.
                </p><p>Private health insurance makes up a tiny proportion of health spending.   About 4% of residents are covered by supplemental voluntary health insurance, but that represents only about 0.2% of health expenditures as of 2009. This supplemental insurance helps to decrease waiting times when seeking medical care, which can be long in Sweden. In 2010, 82% of individuals with voluntary health insurance were covered by their employers. 
                </p><p>Information technology plays an important role in the Swedish healthcare system. Over 90% of primary care physicians use electronic medical records and over 50% of all prescriptions were e-prescriptions in 2009. While hospitals currently have the option to choose their preferred IT systems, there is an ongoing effort to integrate the systems used at a national level, to allow for greater security and system efficiency.

                <p>In addition to the state funded coverage, 38% of the population also opted for complementary voluntary health insurance in 2011, which is provided by non-profit organizations and works to reimburse out-of-pocket healthcare costs for services that the state does not cover. Recently, more people are also looking towards supplementary voluntary health insurance, which allows access to private treatment centers, covers elective surgeries, reduces wait times, and, in some cases, provides lump sum payments to critically ill patients. Supplementary voluntary health insurance is generally provided by employers in the private sector as an employment benefit. In 2010, the government funded 84% of national healthcare expenditure, while 14% of costs were out-of-pocket. The remaining 2% came from voluntary health insurance.
                </p><p>In recent years, Denmark has gravitated towards a more centralized model, lowering the number of regions and municipalities in the country. Consequently, the state has merged hospitals across the industry and is now looking to make improvements to the system. There has been an increased focus on the use of information technology. Free choice of hospitals and the implementation of maximum wait times are some of the latest reforms to the system.
                </p><p>While the market for pharmaceuticals is relatively small in Denmark, it is a leading market for generics, largely due regulations that require pharmacies to fill prescriptions with the lowest-cost generic option available.

                <p>The Department of Health is responsible for setting policy and monitoring the health system. In addition to the NHS, there is a small private sector, funded largely by private medical insurance and direct payments from patients. Some of the costs are also covered by a voluntary and community sector consisting of charitable organizations that operate on a combination of public funds and donations. 
                </p><p>The population of people 65 and over in the UK was 10 million in 2011, and is increasing. According to research firm Ovum, the NHS spends 70% of its budget on this group. There is a trend towards greater usage of home healthcare products and technologies to provide care for this population in a cost effective way. Another healthcare subsector that is on the rise is personalized medicine. The subsector has seen an influx of funds to be used for a variety of research projects.
                </p><p>The UK has struggled in recent years with its budget deficit and the rising cost of healthcare. The National Health Service costs the nation $158 Billion a year. The government is considering options to bring these costs down, including greater privatization within the healthcare industry, which could benefit private providers.

            <div class="germanyLit">
                <p>85% of the population is covered under SHI, with 15% opting to turn towards private insurance. Individuals that earn an annual salary below a pre-specified target, around €50,000, are required to take part in the public healthcare system. Those with salaries above this target, self-employed individuals, and public officers are exempt from this mandatory requirement and can take up private insurance. 
                </p><p>Residents of Germany tend to go to the doctor over six times a year. They also have an average hospital stay of nine days, which is much higher than the 5-6 day average stays for Americans. With costs growing, the state continues to find ways to reduce the burden on SHI. In recent years, there has been a greater cost-sharing component for those who are on SHI, with copays for general practitioner visits, specialist visits, dental care, hospital stays, and pharmaceuticals. In 2010, such cost-sharing measures contributed to 2.85% of total SHI revenue.
                </p><p>The German pharmaceutical market is the world’s third largest, after the US and Japan. Pharmaceutical sales in 2010 were estimated at €31bn. Over half of the drugs produced in the nation are exported. Many of the major pharmaceutical manufacturers in Germany are still family-owned or family-controlled. These firms are investing a great deal in research and development. 
                </p><p>Recent legislation targeting the pharmaceutical sector is aimed at maintaining the affordability of drugs and promoting competition. Drugs are subjected to “reference prices” unless they possess a clearly demonstrated added benefit. Germany’s market for generic drugs is also the largest in Europe, largely due to regulation that often requires mandatory substitution of generics at pharmacies.

                <p>There are two Social Security systems that cover healthcare costs for private (IMSS) and public (ISSSTE) sector employees in Mexico.  Patients receive free medical care and medicines as long as they attend a public health care institution. Hospitals and clinics that provide medical care for Social Security recipients vary in quality. Within the IMSS or ISSSTE, patients cannot choose their primary care providers and the access to care (and hospitals) is regulated by an assigned physician.
                </p><p>In general, private medical care in Mexico is preferred; up to 25% of patients with Social Security benefits or no coverage at all prefer to pay out of pocket for private care.  Since health care in Mexico is generally less expensive, cash payment is still an affordable option for many Mexicans. The cost for a general medical consultation may be as low as $20 USD.
                </p><p>Private hospitals in urban centers offer advanced specialized care centers and most doctors in these institutions have excellent credentials.  Most private hospitals require private insurance or payment prior to treatment.
                </p><p>Mexico is the world’s eleventh largest pharmaceutical market by value and the second largest pharmaceutical market in Latin America, after Brazil. Business Monitor International (BMI) expects the market to grow in value from $9.8bn USD in 2008 to $16.9bn USD by 2013, representing a compound annual growth rate of 11.4%. The market for prescription products is estimated to be close to $8.5bn USD and the market for over-the-counter drugs is estimated to be $1.3bn USD.  However, the distinction between prescription and true OTC drugs is blurred in practice, as prescription products are readily available without prescriptions at pharmacies.  BMI reports that 40% of all retail sales take place without prescriptions.

                <p>SHI covers a small portion of long-term care, such as payments towards nursing home stays or centers for the chronically ill. It only covers what is “medically necessary”. The majority of the costs for these services is paid through a combination of out-of-pocket funds, local government subsidies, and disability insurance. 90% of dental care services are paid for by individuals.
                </p><p>Insurers operating through SHI have incorporated cost sharing by offering a minimum yearly deductible and requiring enrollees to pay 10% copay on all services. They cannot charge different premiums based on age, pre-existing conditions, or health statuses.
                </p><p>In 2009, 60% of all healthcare expenditure came from public funds while 31% came from out-of-pocket payments. An additional 9% of expenditure came through voluntary health insurance, which is generally provided by for-profit insurers. Many people choose to purchase voluntary health insurance to supplement the public plan as a way to receive coverage for services not covered by SHI, greater choice in picking doctors, and better hospital accommodation.
                </p><p>Switzerland is experiencing population growth, an aging demographic, and an increased number of chronic illnesses, including cancer, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. These changing demographics give increasing importance to the healthcare and pharmaceutical industries, which have prospects for high growth in the coming years.
                </p><p>Information technology is also bound to play a larger role in the future of the Swiss healthcare industry. In 2007, a national service called eHealth Suisse was developed with government funding, and is aimed to be an informational resource for healthcare providers, to give providers accessibility to electronic medical records, and to create a national health web site. While still in early stages, this development helps to bring the Swiss healthcare industry into the digital age.
